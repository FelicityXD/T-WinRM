# T-WinRM

This project is made to compromise any target device with WinRM enables and configured.

# SETUP
A seperate setup file is given to make the nesseccary setup for enabling and configuring WinRM connection.
This repo has "twinrm-setup-silent" but it flashes during the execution, so i am trying to fix it and could take a while to complete.
But the executable itself have been done to work without any error(s) at the most.

# This executable is still under development. In case of any error(s) or bug(s) in the program reach out me through the website url in my profile.
