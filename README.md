# T-WinRM

This project is made to compromise any target device with WinRM enables and configured. 


While feeding new command after connecting to the target, press ENTER twice to open and execute another command.  (Fixing this issue takes a lot of time and even sometimes crashes the PowerShell after few executions, mostly by the end of the month the final executable will be hosted online.)

# SETUP
A seperate setup file is given to make the nesseccary setup for enabling and configuring WinRM connection.


This repo has "twinrm-setup-silent" but it flashes during the execution, so i am trying to fix it and could take a while to complete.


But the executable itself have been done to work without any error(s) at the most.

# This executable is still under development. In case of any error(s) or bug(s) in the program reach me out through the website url in my profile.
